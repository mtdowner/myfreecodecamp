### Learn localStorage by Building a Todo App

Local storage is a web browser feature that lets web applications store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. This allows web apps to save data during one session, then retrieve it in a later page session.

In this TODO application, you'll learn how to handle form inputs, manage local storage, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.

### Learn Recursion by Building a Decimal to Binary Converter

Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself. This can reduce a complex problem into simpler sub-problems, until they become straightforward to solve.

In this project, you’ll build a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. You’ll learn the fundamental concepts of recursion, explore the call stack, and build out a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation.

### Learn Regular Expressions by Building a Spam Filter

Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions are powerful, but can be difficult to understand because they use so many special characters.

In this spam filter project, you'll learn about capture groups, positive lookaheads, negative lookaheads, and other techniques to match any text you want.

### Learn Basic Algorithmic Thinking by Building a Number Sorter

In computer science, there are fundamental sorting algorithms that all developers should learn. In this number sorter project, you'll learn how to implement and visualize different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort – all with JavaScript.

This project will help you understand the fundamental concepts behind these algorithms, and how you can apply them to sort numerical data in web applications.

### Learn Advanced Array Methods by Building a Statistics Calculator
