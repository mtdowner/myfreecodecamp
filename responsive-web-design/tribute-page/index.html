       Pause and enjoy a cold popsicle once in awhile. It's the perfect time to spend by yourself with your own thoughts. The same thoughts that keep you up at night wondering what you're doing with your life. Come on man, get a job: you're turning 42 this year. The ladies don't find it cute that you're sitting at home on a Tuesday afternoon eating popsicles.

       See? Popsicles everywhere helping people face reality and get on with their lives.
